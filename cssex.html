        The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.</p>

<p>The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.</p>

<p>Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.</p>

<p>Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

<h1>The CSS id Selector</h1>
<div id="divv">The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.</div><br><br>
